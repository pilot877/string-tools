# string-tools
A set of tools for strings I have made, while small and simple, it is not intended for actual use but simply as a hobby project

## how do I compile it
CMakeLists.txt is provided, generated by CLion.
There are no external libs used, so a simple gcc compile will also work.

## can i contribute?
Yes! this is a learning experience for me, so any contributions to fixing and refactoring the code are welcome, so long as an explanation is provided as to why such changes are being made.
